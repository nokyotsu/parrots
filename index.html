<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It’s a very interesting, and unusual, and weird experience for me to be talking
in my home town. Which is … <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Now, amongst the books that <a href="https://www.femst.ucsb.edu/people/constance-penley">Constance</a> mentioned when she’s introducing me,
<em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide, Dirk Gently</em> and so on, it was not my favourite book. And
my favourite book is what I’m here to talk about tonight. Virtually every author I know, their own favourite book is the one that sold the least. It’s somehow the runt of the litter, it’s the one you’ve always just loved the most.
And I want to tell you about how this came about.</p>
<h2>The Aye-aye</h2>
<p>Sometime in about the mid 1980s, the phone rang. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And the voice said, “We want you to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. We want you to look
for a very rare form of lemur, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aye-aye">Aye-aye</a>. The plane leaves in two
weeks, we would like you to be on it.” Now I—assuming they’ve got the wrong
number—said “yes!” before they could discover their mistake. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
But in fact it turned out that they decided, “Well, here is somebody who
doesn’t know anything about lemurs, anything about the Aye-aye, anything about
Madagascar, let’s send him.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
So I started to try and find out something about it, and it turns out
it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Lemurs used to be the dominant primate in all the world. And they were very,
very gentle, pleasant creatures. They were a little bit like sort of cat
size, and they used to hang around in the trees having a nice time.
And then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwanaland">Gondwanaland</a> split up. It always sounds like some sort of 70’s rock
group going their own way for reasons of musical differences. But as you
probably remember Gondwanaland was that vast continental landmass that
consisted of what then became South America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia,
Australasia—uh, no—Australia, <em>Australia</em> and <em>not</em>—and this will turn out to
be significant later—not New Zealand which turns out to be just a lot of gunk
that came out from under the ocean. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And as I say, lemurs were the dominant primate around the world, and when all
these landmasses split up, and Madagascar was one of them, Madagascar kind of
sailed off into the middle of what then suddenly became the Indian Ocean.
And took with it a representative sample of the livestock of the period, which
included a lot of lemurs. And they basically sort of sat there for millions
and millions of years in glorious isolation. While, in the rest of the world,
a new creature emerged. A new creature arrived that was much more intelligent
than the lemurs—according to it—, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> much more competitive, much
more aggressive, and incredibly interested in all of things you could do with
twigs. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Twigs were absolutely wonderful. There is so much you can do with twigs—you
can dig in the ground for things with twigs, you can burrow under the bark of
trees for grubs, you can hit each other with twigs. If there had been copies
of <em>TwigUser Magazine</em> around on those days, these creatures would have been
lining up for it.
And these creatures—which, as you have probably guessed, are called the
monkeys—, because they were more competitive and more aggressive, and they lived
in the same habitat as the lemurs, they successfully supplanted the lemurs
everywhere in the world other than Madagascar. Because Madagascar was right
out in the middle of the Indian Ocean and they couldn’t get there.</p>
<p>They couldn’t get there until about 1500 years ago, when due to startling
advances in twig technology <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> they were able to get there in boats,
and eventually planes. And suddenly the lemurs, that have had this place for
themselves for millions and millions and millions of years, were suddenly facing
their old enemy: the monkey.
So, this is Madagascar, and it turns out that the rarest of the lemurs—and when
I say the rarest of the lemurs, at this particular point in the mid 80’s they were
thought to be the rarest of the lemurs; we’ve now discovered and even rarer
lemur called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bamboo_Lemur">Golden Bamboo Lemur</a>, which went straight to the number one
of endangered lemurs—but the Aye-aye is a very very peculiar animal. It looks
like the agglomeration of all sorts of other different animals. So, for
instance, it has a sort of foxy ears, and it has a little sort of bitty rabbit’s
teeth, and it has a kind of ostrich feathered tail, and it has very weird
eyes, actually it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Feldman">Marty Feldman</a>’s eyes. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> The kind of sort
of looking slightly beyond you into a sort of other dimension just over your
left shoulder. But it also has one very very very peculiar characteristic,
which is its middle finger on both hands is skeletally thin and very very
long. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And it turns out there is only one other animal in the entire world that has
this feature. And this is called—I love zoologists; they have such vivid
imaginations—it’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Fingered_Possum">Long-Fingered Possum</a>. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And this
is a creature that lives in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and in fact it is its fourth
finger that is skeletally thin and elongated. And this is the thing that tells
us that there is no relationship between these animals, it’s pure convergent
evolution, because the common factor between Madagascar and the Aye-aye, and
New Guinea and the Long-Fingered Possum is that in both habitats there are no
woodpeckers. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
And you see, the thing is—life is very very opportunistic, and it will
take advantage of any food source it finds around the place. And if there are
no woodpeckers looking under the bark of trees for grubs, then, in this case,
it will be the mammals that grow the skeletally thin long finger to burrow
under the bark of the tree, and get to this source of food which is the grubs
under the bark.</p>
<p>So, the Aye-aye is this very very very strange creature. And at this time it
was thought there were only about fifteen of them left. And they lived actually
not on Madagascar itself, but on a tiny little rainforest island just off the
coast of Madagascar, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosy_Mangabe">Nosy Mangabe</a>, and it’s just off the northwest tip
of Madagascar. And now to get there, what you have to do, is you have to fly
in a 747 to Madagascar. And then in a terrible old <em>jalopy</em> of an airplane from
Madagascar up to the northwest port. And from there you have to go in a kind
of decreasingly excellent series of carts and trucks and so on, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> to
a little port where there was going to be a boat that was going to take us to
Nosy Mangabe. So we arrived there, and arrived at the port, and we were
looking around for the boat that was going to take us to Nosy Mangabe, and we
couldn’t see it. And we kept in turn asking people—you know—“where is this
boat?”, and they would say “it’s there! it’s there!”, and we couldn’t see what
they were pointing at because there was this terrible rotting old hulk in the
way. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Well as you guessed, this is the terrible rotting old hulk in which we have to
go to Nosy Mangabe. And it didn’t fulfill what to my mind was the
sort of basic criteria of a boat, in that it was basically full of ocean.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And it seemed to me that the whole point of a boat was to keep the
ocean on the outside. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
Anyway, so we crossed to Nosy Mangabe. And it’s this tiny little, very very
beautiful little rainforest island. And we hit a major problem which of course
is that this animal not only lives in trees—nobody has seen it for years
and years and years—lives in trees but it’s also a nocturnal animal. And the
quality of batteries in Madagascar is very very poor. So, we spent night after
night after night, traipsing through the rainforest, in what can only be
described as: the rain. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Getting rather ratty, and basically we’ve just spent night after night sort
of huddled under tarpaulins, looking at us, saying “stop raining.” And
every now and then we would sort of, “gah, I’ve been trying to find this
damn animal.” Actually, this is wonderful, we found this hut that used to be this sort of game warden’s—not game warden—a ranger’s hut. And it’s a tiny little hut. And it was actually full of wild life. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> What happened, you see,
is you would open the door, and you hear all this noise
<span class="action-description">(makes chomping noises)</span> and you turn on the light and it would all stop.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And you would see these little giant spiders
around the wall, each with  a sort of half-eaten <em>bug</em> in their mouth!
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And say, “yes?” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And you turn the light out
and <span class="action-description">(makes chomping noises)</span>.</p>
<p>So this is our shelter, you know, we were having a great time. But one
night, one night, we were all sort of—as I said—huddled under our tarpaulins,
and I sort of got out, and wandered around, and suddenly, suddenly, I looked
up and at a branch at about that high above my head
<span class="action-description">(looks up and jumps to indicate height)</span>, this creature came
out. This creature came out along the branch, looked down on me, and I looked
at it, and as it looked to me—it obviously didn’t at all like to look at
what it saw—it turned around and went away again. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
Whole encounter about ten seconds. And that’s what we’ve come for.</p>
<p>I had actually seen, we all saw—just managed to get a quick
photograph of it when it appeared—but I suddenly realised we’ve seen an
Aye-aye. Now, I was absolutely transfixed by that moment, for reasons that I
couldn’t entirely explain to myself immediately. Because a month earlier I’ve
never even heard of this animal and now here I was, staring at it, thinking
that something extraordinary happening here. So I began to sort of think about
it a little bit, and the thought I put together was this. In traveling
here, in traveling on a 747 to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tananarive">Tananarive</a>, which is the capital of
Madagascar, and this terrible old jalopy of an airplane that took us out to the
northwest corner, and then in the decreasingly excellent series of carts and
trucks, and then in the rotting old hulk that took us to the rainforest where
we basically walked through the rainforest night after night, it was as if we
were taking a kind of time journey—a time travel journey—back through the
history of twig technology. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And what this encounter had been, what this encounter had been was: I was a
monkey looking at a lemur. And you suddenly think, there is a huge amount of
history to this moment that we don’t think—we don’t realise—we carry
around with us. Our roots in this planet go back an awfully awfully awfully
long way, and we don’t tend to think about that very much. And it takes a
confrontation like this to suddenly realise how sort of broad and deep your
family goes. So I thought, well this is terribly interesting. And I talked to
the guy who had been kind of my guide out there, who was a zoologist who had
been sent along to make sure I didn’t sort of fall out of the trees and so on.
And his name was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Carwardine">Mark Carwardine</a>, and I said to him, “I would love it if
we could …, do you fancy the idea of sort of going around the world and
looking for other rare and endangered species of animals, maybe doing a book
about this?” He said, “well, that’s what I do for a living!” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
“So yeah, OK.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<h2>The Komodo Dragon Lizard</h2>
<p>And so we did. Now, there was a pause at that moment because I had a couple of
novels I’ve just been contracted to write. So I wrote
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently's_Holistic_Detective_Agency">Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Dark_Tea-Time_of_the_Soul">The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</a>, and <em>then</em> it was time to go.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And the first place we went, we went to look for a particular
animal which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_Dragon">Komodo Dragon Lizard</a>. Now you know
what lizards are like, don’t you? I mean they’re sort of
<span class="action-description">(makes mime with hands to suggest a size of about 12 inches)</span>.
The Komodo Dragon Lizard is a little bit bigger than that. The biggest
one we saw actually it
was about 13 feet long, and its head came out to about here
<span class="action-description">(makes mime with hands to suggest a height to about his hip)</span>,
fucking huge I think is the technical term. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
It’s thought to be the origin of the chinese dragon myth—because they
are well huge, giant giant lizards, they’re scaly, they’re man eaters,
literally they’re man eaters, and they don’t actually breathe fire, but they
<em>do</em> have the worst breath of any creature known to man.</p>
<p>And they live on this island called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_(island)">Komodo</a>.
Now, it’s not enough—it turns out—that this island has fifteen hundred,
fifteen hundred man-eating dragons on it. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
It turns our that actually that the most endangered animal on the
island is anything <em>other</em> than the dragons. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
In fact—as I said—they’re man eaters. They don’t actually eat you sort
of straight out, they don’t sort of lunge at you and just gobble you up.
They sort of sneak around and they come and give you a bit of a bite.
Because their saliva is so virulent that
your wound would not heal and after a while you will die. And so one of the
dragons will get to eat you—it doesn’t matter if it’s the same one that bit
you—they just have a strategy of having as many dead and dying creatures
lying around the island <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> as they can manage
and that kind of keeps them going.</p>
<p>But it turns out it’s not enough that the island has fifteen hundred
man-eating dragons on it. Just to make it a little bit more interesting, it
also has more poisonous snakes on it—per square meter of land—than any
equivalent area of land anywhere on earth. So, we approach Komodo—I have to
say—slightly nervously, and in a slightly roundabout way. In fact we
approached in such a roundabout way that went by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in Australia.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And the reason we went by Melbourne was somebody who we wanted
to go and see there, a man called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struan_Sutherland">Dr. Struan Sutherland</a>.
Actually I want to read you a little bit about him, he was a great expert in
snake venom.</p>
<p>I should apologise before I read this, actually, for the fact that
my australian accent isn’t very good. But then, what the hell, you’re
all americans you ain’t know the difference anyway. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<blockquote><p>There is in Melbourne a man who probably knows more about poisonous snakes
than anyone else on earth. His name is Dr. Struan Sutherland, and he has
devoted his entire life to a study of venom.</p>
<p>“And I’m bored at talking about it,” he said when we went along to see him
the next morning laden with tape recorders and notebooks. “Can’t stand
all these poisonous creatures, all these snakes and insects and fish and
things. Wretched things, biting everybody. And then people expect me to
tell them what to do about it. I’ll tell them what to do. Don’t get bitten
in the first place. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> That’s the answer. I’ve had enough of
telling people all the time. Hydroponics, now that’s interesting.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Talk to you all you like about hydroponics. Fascinating stuff,
growing plants artificially in water, very interesting technique. We’ll need
to know all about it if we’re going to go to Mars and places. Where did you
say you were going?”</p>
<p>“Komodo.”</p>
<p>“Well don’t get bitten, that’s all I can say. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And don’t come
running to me if you do because you won’t get here in time, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and
anyway I’ve got enough on my plate. Look at this office, full of poisonous
animals all over the place. See this tank, it’s full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fire_ants">fire ants</a>. Venomous
little creatures. What are we going to do about them? Anyway, I got some
little fairy cakes in case you were hungry. Would you like some little cakes?
I can’t remember where I put them. There’s some tea but it’s not very good.
Anyway, sit down for heaven’s sake.</p>
<p>“So, you’re going to Komodo. Well, I don’t know why you want to do that but I
suppose you have your reasons. There are fifteen different types of snake on
Komodo, and half of them are poisonous. The only potentially deadly ones are
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_Viper">Russell’s Viper</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimeresurus_stejnegeri">Bamboo Viper</a>
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Cobra">Indian Cobra</a>.</p>
<p>“The Indian cobra is the fifteenth deadliest snake in the world, and all the
other fourteen are here in Australia. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> That’s why it’s so hard
for me to find time to get on with my hydroponics, with all these snakes all
over the place.</p>
<p>“And spiders. The most poisonous spider is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_funnel-web">Sydney funnel-web</a>, we get
about five hundred people a year bitten by spiders. A lot of them used to
die, so I had to develop an antidote to stop people bothering me with it all
the time. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Took us years. Then we developed this snake bite
detector kit. Not that you need a kit to tell you when you’ve been bitten by
a snake, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> you usually know, but the kit is something that will
detect what type you’ve been bitten by so you can treat it properly.</p>
<p>“Would you like to see a kit? I’ve got a couple here in the venom fridge.
Let’s have a look. Ah look, the cakes are in here too. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Quick,
have one while they’re still fresh. Fairy cakes, I baked ’em myself”</p>
<p>He handed round the snake venom detection kits and these home baked fairy
cakes and retreated back to his desk, where he beamed at us cheerfully from
behind his curly beard and bow tie. We admired the kits which were small
efficient boxes neatly packed with tiny bottles, a pipette, a syringe, and a
complicated set of instructions that I wouldn’t want to have to read for the
first time in a panic. And then we asked him how many of the snakes he had
been bitten by himself.</p>
<p>“None of ’em,” he said. “Another area of expertise I’ve developed is that
of getting other people to handle the dangerous animals. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Won’t
do it myself. Don’t want to get bitten, do I? <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> You know what it
says on my book jackets? ‘Hobbies: gardening, with gloves; <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span>
fishing, with boots; travelling, with care.’ That’s the answer. What else?
Well in addition to the boots wear thick baggy trousers. And preferably have
half a dozen people trampling along in front of you making as much noise as
possible. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> The snakes pick up the vibrations and get out of your
way. Unless it’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthophis">Death Adder</a>, otherwise known as the
<em>Deaf</em> Adder, <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> which just lies there. People can walk right past
it and over it and nothing happens. I’ve heard of twelve people in a line
walking over a Death Adder and the twelfth person accidentally trod on it
and got bitten. Normally it’s quite safe to get twelve in line. You’re not
eating your cakes. Come on, get them down you, there’s plenty more in the
venom fridge.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>We asked, tentatively, if we could perhaps take a snake bite detector kit with
us to Komodo.</p>
<p>“Course you can, course you can. Take as many as you like. Won’t do you a
blind bit of good because they’re only for Australian snakes.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“So what do we do if we get bitten by something deadly, then?” I asked.</p>
<p>He blinked at me as if I were stupid. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“Well what do you think you do?” he said. “You die of course. That’s what
deadly means.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“But what about cutting open the wound and sucking out the poison?”
I asked.</p>
<p>“Rather you than me,” he said. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> “I wouldn’t want a mouthful
of poison. Shouldn’t do you any harm, though, snake toxins are of high
molecular weight so they wont penetrate the blood vessels in the mouth the
way that alcohol or some drugs do. And then the poison gets destroyed by the
acids in your stomach. But it’s not necessarily going to do much good either.
I mean, you’re not likely to be able to get much of the poison out, but
you’re probably going to make the wound a lot worse trying. And in a place
like Komodo it means you’d quickly have a seriously infected wound to contend
with well as a leg full of poison. Septicaemia, gangrene, you name it,
it’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>“What about a tourniquet?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, fine if you don’t mind having your leg cut off afterwards. You’d have
to because if you cut off the blood supply to it completely it will just die.
And if you can find anyone in that part of Indonesia who you’d trust to take
your leg off then you’re a braver man than me. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> No, I’ll tell
you, the only thing you can do is apply a pressure bandage direct to the
wound and wrap the whole leg up tightly, but not too tightly. Slow the blood
flow but don’t cut it off or you’ll lose the leg. Hold your leg, or whatever
bit you’ve been bitten in, lower than your heart and your head. Keep very,
very still, breathe slowly and get to a doctor immediately. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
If you’re on Komodo that means a couple of days, by which time you’ll be well
dead. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“Now, the only answer, and I mean this quite seriously, is don’t get bitten.
There’s no reason why you should. Any of the snakes there will get out of
your way well before you even see them. You don’t really need to worry about
the snakes if you’re careful. No, the things you really need to worry about
are the marine creatures.”</p>

People drown themselves just to stop the pain.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“Where are all these things?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just in the sea. Tons of them. I wouldn’t go near it if I were you.
Full of poisonous animals. Hate them.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“Is there anything you do like?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Hydroponics.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“No”, I said, “I mean are there any poisonous creatures you’re
particularly fond of?”</p>
<p>He looked out of the window for a moment.</p>
<p>“There was,” he said, “but she left me.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Kakapo</h2>
<p>Anyway, in fact my favourite of all the animals we went to see, my favourite,
was an animal called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo">Kakapo</a>. And the Kakapo is a kind of parrot. It
lives in New Zealand. It’s a flightless parrot, it has forgotten how to fly.
Sadly, it has also forgotten that it has forgotten how to fly. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
So a seriously worried Kakapo has been known to run up a tree and jump out of
it. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Opinion divides as to what next happens: <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> some
people said it has developed a kind of rudimentary parachuting ability,
<span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> other people says it flies a bit like a brick. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>But the thing is—I might talk about a seriously worried Kakapo—the fact is
you’re not likely to find a seriously worried Kakapo because Kakapos have not
learned to worry. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> It seems an extraordinary thing to say because
worrying is something we’re all so terribly good at, and which comes so
absolutely naturally to us, we think it must be as natural as breathing. But
it turns out that worrying is simply an acquired habit like anything else. It’s
something you’re genetically disposed to do or not to do. And the thing is that
the Kakapo grew up in New Zealand which was, until man arrived, a country which
had no predators. And it’s predators that, over a series of generations, will
teach you to worry. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And if you don’t have predators then the need
to worry will never occur to you.</p>
<p>Now I said earlier, that New Zealand turns out to be just a load of gunk that
came out from under the ocean. And this is why, when it emerged, it didn’t
have any life on it at all—maybe a few dead fish. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> So the only
animals that inhabited New Zealand were the animals that could fly there,
i.e. birds. There were are also a couple of species of bats which are mammals,
but you get the point. So it was only birds that lived on New Zealand. And, in
an absence of predators, there was nothing for them to worry about. Now it’s
very very peculiar for us to try and understand this because we have never ever
encountered an environment with no predators in it. Why not? Because we are
predators and because, therefore, if we are in that environment it is a
predated environment.
For the europeans who originally arrived in New Zealand, … sorry, that was
an extraordinary thing to say. Of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Māori">Māoris</a> before them and before
then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriori">Morioris</a>, the Māoris <em>ate</em> the Morioris <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and then
the europeans came along. But before all of that happened—as I said—the
island had no predators, and the birds basically lived a worry-free life.</p>
<p>Now you can actually see another example of this if you go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galápagos">Galápagos</a>,
there is a type of animal, there is a bird on the Galápagos Islands called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-footed_Booby">Blue-footed Booby</a>. And the Blue-footed Booby is so called—I believe—for
two reasons: one of which has to be with the colour of his feet, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span>
and the other has to do with this piece of behaviour I’m about to describe.
Because, apparently you can walk up to a Blue-footed Booby—it will be sitting
there on the beach or on a branch—and you can walk up and you can sort of
pick him up. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And what the Booby will be thinking is that once you
finish with him you’ll put him back. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
And if you haven’t lived through generation after generation of people trying
to eat you, it’s very easy to come to that conclusion. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>So the Kakapo, as I say, had grown up in an environment without predators. And
because they were all birds, and because nature has a way—as I say—very
opportunistic and life will flow into any niche where it’s possible to make a
living, so—if I can be very naughty and anthropomorphise for a moment—it’s
as if some of the birds figured out, “Well, this flying stuff is very very
expensive. It takes a lot of energy, you have to eat a bit, fly a bit, eat a
bit, fly a bit, because every time you eat something—you know—you weight
down and it’s heavier to fly, so eat a bit, fly a bit—I mean—there are
other ways of life available.” And so it’s as if some of the birds said, “Well,
actually what we could do is we could settle in for a rather larger meal, and
go for a waddle afterwards!” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And so gradually over many many generations a lot of the birds lost the
ability to fly, they took up life on the ground. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi">Kiwi</a>, the most famous
bird—I guess—of New Zealand, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka">Weka</a>, and the old night
parrot—as it was called—the Kakapo. Which is this sort of big, fat, soft,
fluffy, lugubrious bird. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And because it has never learned to
worry, when man arrived and brought with him his deadly menagerie of dogs, and
cats, and stoats, and the most destructive of all animals–other than
man—which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattus_rattus">Rattus rattus</a>, the ship’s rat. Suddenly, suddenly these
birds were waddling for their lives. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Except in fact they didn’t
know how to do that because they were confronted with an animal which was a
predator, they didn’t know what to do, they didn’t know what the social form
was, they just waited for the other animal to make the next move, and of
course—as usually—a fairly swift and deadly one. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>So, suddenly from there being a population of—we don’t know exactly of how
many—probably not as many as a million, but hundreds of thousands of these
birds, their population plunged at an incredible rate down into the low
forties. Which is roughly where it is at the moment. And, so there are groups
of people who dedicated their entire lives to try to save these animals, trying
to conserve them. And one of the problems they’ve come across is that it’s all
very well just to protect them—from predators—which is very very very hard
to do. But the next problem they come across is the mating habits of the
Kakapo. Because it turns out that the mating habits of the Kakapo are
incredibly long drawn-out, fantastically complicated, and almost entirely
ineffective. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Some people would tell you that the mating call of the male Kakapo <em>actively</em>
repels the female Kakapo, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> which is the sort of behaviour you would otherwise only find really in discotheques. The people who’ve heard the mating
call of the male Kakapo will tell you, you can hardly even hear it, it’s like a
sort of … I’ll tell you what they do.
This animal every—for about a hundred nights of the year—it goes through
its mating ritual.</p>
<p>And what it does is it finds some great rocky outcrop looking out over the
great rolling valleys of New Zealand, because acoustics are very important for
what it’s about to happen. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
It carves out this kind of bowl that it sits in. And it sits there, and it puffs
out this great sort of air-sacks around his chest. And it sits there—and these
are reverberation chambers, this is a kind of reverberation chamber—and it
sits there and for night after night after night for a hundred nights of the
year, for eight hours of the night, it performs the opening bars of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="ref-dark-side-of-the-moon"><a href="#dark-side-of-the-moon">1</a></sup> <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
Now, I see some grey hairs here so you’ll know the album I’m referring to.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
Which as you remember starts with this great sort of <em>boom</em>, <em>boom</em>, <em>boom</em>,
it’s a heartbeat sound. And this is the noise, that the Kakapo
makes. But it’s so, it’s so deep, that you more kind of feel it like a wobble
in the pit of your stomach. You can only just sort of tune your hearing in to
it. Now I never managed to get to hear it, but those who do say they feel it’s
a very <em>eerie</em> sound because you don’t really hear it, you more kind of feel it.</p>
<p>And, it’s bass sound. It’s very very deep bass sound, just below our level of
our hearing. Now it turns out that bass sound has two important
characteristics to it. One of which is that these great long waves, these
great long sound waves travel great distances, and they fill these great
valleys of the south island of New Zealand. And that’s good. That’s good. But
there is another characteristic of bass sounds, which you may be familiar
with, if you’ve got this kind of—you know—the kind of stereo speakers you can
get. Where you have two tiny little ones that give you your treble sound, and
you have to put them very carefully in the room, because they’re going to
define the stereo image. And then you have what’s known as a subwoofer which
is the bass box, and that’s going to produce just the bass sound and you can
put that anywhere in the room you like. You can put it behind the sofa if you
like, because the other characteristic of bass sound—and remember we’re
talking about the mating call of the male Kakapo—is that you can’t tell where
it’s coming from! <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>So just imagine if you will, this male Kakapo sitting up here, making all this
booming noise which, if there’s a female out there—which there probably
isn’t—and if she likes the sound of this booming—which she probably
doesn’t—then she can’t find the person who’s making it! <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
But supposing she does, supposing she’s out there—but she probably
isn’t—she likes the sound of this booming—she probably doesn’t—supposing
that she can find him—which she probably can’t—she will then only consent
to mate if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarpus">Podocarpus</a> tree is in fruit! <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Now we’ve all had relationships like that … <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
<p>But supposing they get through all those obstacles, supposing she manages to
find him, she will then lay one egg every two or three years which will
promptly get eaten by a stoat or rat. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And you think, well so
far—before trying to sort of save them and conserve them—how on earth has
it managed to survive for this long!</p>
<p>And the answer is terribly interesting, which is this: it seems like
absurd behaviour to us, but it’s only because its environment has changed in
one particular and dramatic way that is completely invisible to us. And its
behaviour is perfectly attuned to the environment it developed in, and
completely out of tune with the environment it now finds itself in. Because in
an environment when nothing is trying to predate you, you don’t want to
reproduce too fast. And it turns out you can actually sort of graph this in a
computer. That if you take a given reproduction rate, and you take the ability
of any given environment to sustain any particular level of population. And
you start say with a fairly low reproduction rate, and you just plot it over
several generations and you find that the population goes up and up and up and
then sort of steadies out and achieves a nice plateau. Tweak the reproduction
rate up a bit, and it goes up a little bit higher, and then maybe settles
down, and levels out. Tweak the reproduction rate a little bit higher yet, and
it goes up, and it goes too high, and it drops down, it goes too low, goes up,
too high, and settles into an oscillating sine wave. Tweak it a bit more, and
it starts to oscillate between four different values. Tweak it more and more
and more and you suddenly hit this terribly fashionable condition called
chaos. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
Where the population of the animal just swings wildly from one year to
another, and will just hit zero at one point just out of the sheer mathematics
of the situation. And once you’ve hit zero, there is kind of no coming back.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And so, because because nature tends to be very parsimonious and is not going
to expend energy and resources on something for which there is no return. So
the reproduction rate of an animal in an environment with no predators will
tune itself to an appropriate level of reproduction. Now, if there is nothing
trying to eat you—particularly—then that reproduction rate will be very
low. And that is the rate at which the Kakapo <em>used</em> to reproduce, and continues
to reproduce despite the fact that it’s being predated, because it doesn’t
know any better. Because nothing has managed to teach it anything different
along the way, because the change that occurred happened so suddenly, that
there is no kind of slope, there is no slope of gradual evolutionary pressure,
which is the thing that tends to bring about change. If you have a sudden
dramatic change then there is no direction to go and you just have disaster.</p>
<p>So, again if I can anthropomorphise for a moment, what seems to have happened
is that the animal suddenly reaching a crisis in his population thinks, “Whoa,
whoa! I better just do, do, what I do fantastically well, do what is my main
thing, which is I reproduce really really slowly!” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And its
population goes down. “Well, I’d better really do what I do, and reproduce
really really really really slowly!” And it seems absurd to us because we can
see a larger picture than they can. But if that is the type of behaviour that
you’ve evolved successfully to produce, then to do anything else would be
against kakapo-nature, would be an <em>inkakapo</em> thing to do. And it has nothing
to teach it any other than to just do what it’s always done, to follow its
successful strategy, and because times have changed around it, it’s no longer
a successful strategy, and the animal is in terrible trouble.</p>
<h2>The Yangtze River Dolphin</h2>
<p>There is another animal we went to find, it is in even worse trouble now. And
this is the Baiji, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River_Dolphin">Yangtze River Dolphin</a>, which is an almost blind river
dolphin. The reason it’s almost blind, is that there is <em>nothing</em> to see in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River">Yangtze River</a>. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Thousands and thousands of years of agriculture along the banks
of the Yangtze River have washed so much mud and silt and so on into it, that the
river has become completely turbid. Which is a word I didn’t even know the
meaning of until I saw the Yangtze River, and basically you can’t see anything
in it. So these animals, dolphins as I said, gradually they abandoned the use
of sight. Now—as we all know—marine mammals also have this other faculty
available to them, which they can develop, which is that of sound. And so what
the Yangtze River Dolphins did was over thousands of years, as their eye sight
deteriorated, so their sonar abilities became more and more and more
sophisticated, and more powerful and more complex.</p>
<p>And it’s very interesting, you can actually watch—if you feel like it—the
development of a Baiji foetus, and you’ll see that right at—as you may or may
not know—there is a certain amount of truth in the idea that the development of
the foetus recapitulates stages in the evolutionary development of an animal.
And you see, right at the beginning of the development of the foetus, its eyes
are in the normal dolphin position, which are kind of relatively far down on the
side of the head.
And gradually, as the generations have gone by, its eyes have kind
of migrated up the side of the head, and you see this happening as the foetus
develops. Because gradually, over the generations, its only light is coming
directly from up above and there is no ambient light and then, as that too
dies out, so the eyes gradually atrophied. And, instead, the sonar abilities
take over. And these animals developed incredibly sensitive, and incredibly
precise abilities to navigate themselves around in the water just using sonar.
And all is well and good.</p>
<p>Until the twentieth century when man invents the diesel engine. And suddenly
all hell breaks loose beneath the surface of the Yangtze, because it’s suddenly
full of noise. And so, suddenly these animals find themselves trapped by
something that they—that nobody had any means of foreseeing—that the thing
they now rely on has been completely overwhelmed by the noise pollution that we
put in the oceans. So suddenly these animals that used to be so sophisticated
in their ability to find their way around, are sort of bumping into things,
bumping into boats, bumping into ships’ propellers, finding themselves
ensnared in fishermen’s nets and so on, because we basically screwed up the next
of their faculties. And it’s a very curious feeling, I remember sort of
sitting on a boat on the Yangtze River and looking, well trying to look
into—you couldn’t look into cause it’s turbid and you remember what turbid
means—and realising that all this noise down there means that …
It’s very curious to think that there may have been a dolphin
somewhere near me—I didn’t know, I mean by this stage, this was ten years
ago, there were only two hundred left in a structure of water of about two
hundred miles long, so you had no idea if there was one anywhere near
you—but it’s curious because you think if you and another person, another
creature, are kind of in the same world, then you must be feeling roughly
similar. But one of the things you begin to realise when you look at different
animals is that because of their evolutionary history, and because of
the forms they have developed into, and the ways they have developed of
perceiving the world, they may be inhabiting the same world but actually a
completely different universe. But actually a completely different universe
because you create your only own universe from what you do with the sensory
data coming in. So, you realise that you’re here, and there is a dolphin
there, and you’re comfortable, and the dolphin may be actually in a species of
hell. But has no means of communicating that with you because we’ve kind of
taken charge, and there is no way of kind of communicating with the
management, there’s a problem. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>So, I suddenly became very interested in what it must actually sound like in
the Yangtze River. Now, we’ve gone to record some BBC Radio programmes while we
are there, so as well as Mark Carwardine the zoologist, we also had a sound
recordist from the BBC. So I said to him, “Could we actually drop a microphone
into the Yangtze so that we can see what it actually sounds like in the
river?” And he said, “Well you should have said that before we left London.”
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And I said, “Why?” And he said, “Well, cause I just could
have checked out a waterproof microphone but, you know, you didn’t mention
anything about recording under water.” And I said, “No, I didn’t. Is there
anything we could do about it?” And he said, “Well there is, there is
actually one technique they teach us at the BBC for recording under water in
an emergency. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Do either of you have condoms with you?”</p>
<p>And we didn’t. Wasn’t that kind of trip. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> But we decided we’d
better go and buy some. And so we went into the streets of Shanghai trying
to buy some condoms, and I just want to read you a little passage about this.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Friendship Store seemed like a promising place to buy condoms,
<span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> but we had a certain amount of difficulty in getting the idea
across. We passed from one counter to another in the large open-plan
department store, which consists of many different individual booths,
stalls and counters, but no one was able to help us.</p>
<p>We first started at the stalls which looked as if they sold medical supplies,
but had no luck. By the time we had got to the stalls which sold bookends and
chopsticks we knew we were on to a loser, but at least we found a young shop
assistant who spoke English.</p>
<p>We tried to explain to her what it was we wanted, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> but seemed to
reach the limit of her vocabulary pretty quickly. So, I got out my notebook
and drew a condom very carefully, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> including the little extra
balloon on the end.</p>
<p>She frowned at it, but still didn’t get the idea. She brought us a wooden
spoon, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> a candle, a sort of paper knife and, surprisingly enough,
a small porcelain model of the Eiffel Tower <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and then at last
lapsed into a posture of defeat.</p>
<p>Some other girls from the stall gathered round to help, but they were also
defeated by our picture. At last I plucked up the bravado to perform a
delicate little mime, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and at last the penny dropped.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“Ah!” the first girl said, suddenly wreathed in smiles. “Ah yes!”</p>
<p>They all beamed delightedly at us as they got the idea.</p>
<p>“You do understand?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “Not have.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“But, but, but …”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I say you where you go, OK?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you very much. Yes.”</p>
<p>“You go 616 Nanjing Road. OK. They have there. You ask ‘rubberover’. OK?”</p>
<p>“Rubberover?”</p>
<p>“Rubberover. You ask. They have. OK. Have nice day.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>She giggled happily about this with her hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>We thanked them again, profusely, and left with much waving and smiling. The
news seemed to have spread very quickly around the store, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and
everybody waved at us. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> They seemed terribly pleased to have
been asked.</p>
<p>When we reached 616 Nanjing Road, which turned out to be another, smaller
department store, and not a knocking shop as we had been half-suspecting, our
pronunciation of ‘rubberover’ seemed to let us down and produce another wave
of baffled incomprehension.</p>
<p>This time I went straight for the mime that had served us so well before,
<span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and it seemed to do the trick at once. The shop assistant, a
slightly more middle-aged lady with severe hair, marched straight to a
cabinet of drawers, brought us back a packet and placed it triumphantly on
the counter in front of us.</p>
<p>Success, we thought, opened the packet and found it to contain a bubble sheet
of pills.</p>
<p>“Right idea,” said Mark, with a sigh. “Wrong method.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>We were quickly floundering again as we tried to explain to the now slightly
affronted lady that it wasn’t precisely what we were after. By this time a
crowd of about fifteen onlookers had gathered round us, some of whom, I was
convinced, had followed us all the way from the Friendship Store.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> One of the things that you quickly discover in China, is that
we are all at the zoo. If you stand still for a moment, people will gather
round and stare at you. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> The unnerving thing is that they don’t
stare intently or inquisitively, they just stand there, often right in front
of you, and watch you as blankly as if you were a dog food commercial.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>At last one young and pasty-faced man with glasses pushed through the crowd
and said he spoke a little English and could he help?</p>
<p>We thanked him and said, yes, we wanted to buy some condoms, some rubberovers,
and we would be very grateful if he could explain that for us.</p>
<p>He looked puzzled, picked up the rejected packet lying on the counter in
front of the affronted shop assistant and said, “Not want rubberover. This
better.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“No,” Mark said. “We definitely want rubberover, not pills.”</p>
<p>“Why want rubberover? Pill better.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“You tell him,” said Mark. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“It’s to record dolphins,” I said. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> “Or not the actual
dolphins in fact. What we want to record is the noise in the Yangtze
that … it’s to go over the microphone, you see, and …”</p>
<p>“Oh, just tell him you want to fuck someone,” said the sound recordist.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> “And you can’t wait.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>But by now the young man was edging nervously away from us, suddenly
realising that we were dangerously insane, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and should simply be
humoured and escaped from. He said something hurriedly to the shop assistant
and backed away into the crowd.</p>
<p>The shop assistant shrugged, scooped up the pills, opened another drawer and
pulled out a packet of condoms.</p>
<p>We bought nine, just to be safe. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a couple of days later we were standing on the banks of the Yangtze, on a
very desperate drizzly grey day. And we put the microphone in this little
sort of pink thing, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and dropped it into the water. And, I don’t
usually do impressions but I’m going to do for you an impression of what it
sounds like under the surface of the Yangtze River. And it’s something like
this <em>“pfffffffffff”</em>. The Yangtze River ladies and gentleman.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
<p>And, I suddenly realized what an appalling thing we’ve
inflicted on these poor animals, that live in a world of super sensitive sound
and hearing. And this was why these animals were now desperately endangered
because having removed one way of life from them we were now removing a
second. The problem is we’re about to remove a third, I said that when I was
there it was ten years ago, there were two hundred of these left, today there
are twenty. And because the Chinese are building these giant dams to dam the
Yangtze at one of the most beautiful and most spectacular sites in all world,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges">Three Gorges</a>, and they’re damming it there which means that the Yangtze
Dolphin will at that point definitely go extinct.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="ref-yangtze-extinct"><a href="#yangtze-extinct">2</a></sup></p>
<p>And it’s terribly sad. The peculiar thing about dams is that we keep on
building them and none of them ever do any good. It’s not quite true, because
unfortunately there are—in the history of dam-making—two that did work,
one is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam">Hoover</a> and the other is the one up in the pacific
northwest, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Coulee_Dam">Coulee Dam</a>. And every other one doesn’t work.
And for some reason we never manage to be able to quite stop us … we always think we just
build one more. I think must have some sort of beaver genes deep in our …
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> But the sad thing as I say is that the Yangtze River dolphin is
definitely and without doubt bound for extinction.</p>
<h2>The Human</h2>
<p>And, it’s very peculiar to me that we are living at the moment in an
extraordinary age, an extraordinary renaissance, because we’ve
got to the point when we suddenly understand the value of information, as we
never have before. We call the age we live in that of information. And we’ve
discovered that information is the most valuable resource we have. And as
you’d know we’ve just spent billions of dollars—quite rightly—in trying to
understand the human genome, and that’s just one species, that’s just us. And
we’ve come to understand and realize how incredibly valuable this information is.</p>
<p>And we’ve never understood kind of how it all worked together before, because
before we had … let me put it this way. In the past we’ve done science by
taking things apart to see how they work. And it’s led to extraordinary
discoveries, extraordinary degrees of understanding, but the problem with
taking things apart to see how they work is even though it gets you down to
the sort of fundamental particles, the fundamental principles, the fundamental
forces at work, we still don’t <em>really</em> understand how they work until we see
them in motion.</p>
<p>One of the things that came about as a result of our
understanding of these fundamental principles, is that we came to invent this
thing called the computer. And the great thing about the computer is that,
unlike every previous analytical tool—and there are a bit … it’s funny how
many of these have to do with glass, when we first came across glass, which is
a form of sand, and we invented lenses, and we looked up into the sky, and
by studying the sky we began to discover fundamental things about gravity,
and we also discovered that the universe seems to consist—terrifyingly
enough—almost entirely of nothing.
The next thing we did with glass was we put them in microscopes, and we looked
down into this very very very solid world around us, and we see the
fundamental particles there, the atoms—made up of protons and neutrons with
electrons spinning around them—and we also discover that they seem to consist
frighteningly almost entirely of nothing. And that even when you <em>do</em> find
something it turns out that it isn’t actually there, it isn’t actually a thing
there, merely the possibility that there may be something there. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
It kind of doesn’t feel as real as this <span class="action-description">(hits podium with his hand)</span>.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>So the next thing we do with sand was silicon, as we create the
computer. And this finally enables us to start putting things together to see
how they work. And it allows us to see actual processes at work, and we begin to
see how very very simple things lead inexorably—by iteration after
iteration—to enormously complex processes emerging and blossoming. And to my
mind one of the most extraordinary things of our age—I mean those of us who
were around will remember, you know, seeing man walking on the moon for the
first time—but I think the most dramatic and extraordinary thing that we have
seen in our time is being able to see, on computer screens, the process by which
enormously simple primitive things, processes, instructions, repeated many
many times over, very very fast, and iterated over generations of
instructions, produce enormously complex results. So that we can suddenly
start to create, just out of fundamentally simple primitive instructions, we
can create the way in which wind behaves in a wind tunnel, a turbulence of
wind, we can see how light might dance in an imaginary dinosaur’s eye. And we
do it all out of fundamentally simple instructions. And as a result of that we
have finally come to an understanding of the way in which life has actually
emerged. Now, there are an awful lot of things we don’t know about life. But
any life scientist will tell you that, although there is an awful lot we don’t
know, there is no longer a deep mystery. There is no longer a deep mystery
because we have actually seen with our own eyes the way in which simplicity
gives rise to complexity.</p>
<p>When I say there is no mystery it is rather as if you imagine taking
a detective from the 19th century, teaming him up with a detective from the
late 20th century, and giving them this problem to work on: that a suspect in
a crime was seen one day to be walking down the street in the middle of
London, and the next day was seen somewhere out in the desert in the middle
of New Mexico. Now the 19th century detective will say, “Well, I haven’t the
faintest idea. I mean it must be some species of magic has happened.” And he
would have no idea about how to begin to solve what has happened here. For
the 20th century detective, now he may never know whether the guy went on
British Airways or United or American or where he hired his car from, or all
that kind of stuff, he may never find those details, but there wont be any
fundamental mystery about what has happened.</p>
<p>So for us there is no longer a fundamental mystery about life. It is all the
process of extraordinary eruptions of information. And is information that
gives us this fantastically rich complex world in which we live. But at the
same time that we’ve discovered that, we are destroying it at a rate that has
no precedent in history, unless you go back to the point that we’re hit by an
asteroid.</p>
<p>So there is a kind of terrible irony that at the point that we are best able
to understand, and appreciate, and value the richness of life around us, we
are destroying it at a higher rate that it has even been destroyed before. And
we are losing species after species after species, day after day, just
because we’re burning the stuff down for firewood. And this is a kind of
terrible indictment of our understanding. But, you see, we make another
mistake, because we think somehow, this is all right in some fundamental kind
of way, because we think that this is all sort of “meant to happen.”</p>
<p>Now let me explain how we get into that kind of mindset, because it’s exactly
the same kind of mindset that the Kakapo gets trapped in. Because, what has
been a very successful strategy for the Kakapo over generation after
generation for thousands and thousands of years, suddenly is the wrong
strategy, and he has no means of knowing because he is just doing what has
been successful up till then. And we have always been, because we’re
toolmakers, because we take from our environment the stuff that we need to
do what we want to do and it’s always been very successful for us …</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what’s happened. It’s as if we’ve actually kind of put the sort
of “pause” button on our own process of evolution, because we have put a
buffer around us, which consists of—you know—medicine and education and
buildings, and all these kinds of things that protect us from the normal
environmental pressures. And, it’s our ability to make tools that enables us
to do this.
Now, generally speaking, what drives speciation, is that a small group of
animals gets separated out from the main body by population pressure, some
geographical upheaval or whatever. So imagine, a small bunch suddenly finds
itself stranded in a slightly colder environment. Then you know, over a small
number of generations that those genes that favour a thicker coat will come to
the fore and you come back a few generations later, and the animal’s got a
thicker coat.
Man, because we are able to make tools, we arrive in a new environment where
it’s much colder, and we don’t have to wait for that process. Because we see
an animal that’s already got a thicker coat and we say we’ll have it off him.
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span>
And so we’ve kind of taken control of our environment, and that’s all very
well, but we need to be able to sort of rise above that process. We have to
rise above that vision and see a higher vision—and understand the effect
we’re actually having.</p>
<p>Now imagine—if you will—an early man, and let’s just sort of see how this
mindset comes about. He’s standing, surveying his world at the end of the day.
And he looks at it and thinks, “This is a very wonderful world that I find
myself in. This is pretty good. I mean, look, here I am, behind me is the
mountains, and the mountains are great because there are caves in the
mountains where I can shelter, either from the weather or from bears that
occasionally come and try to attack me. And I can shelter there, so that’s
great. And in front of me there is the forest, and the forest is full of nuts and
berries and trees, and they feed me, and they’re delicious and they sort of
keep me going. And here’s a stream going through which has got fish running
through it, and the water is delicious, and I drink the water, and everything’s
fantastic.</p>
<p>“And there’s my cousin Ug. And Ug has caught a mammoth! Yay!! <span class="action-description">(claps)</span>. Ug
has caught a mammoth! Mammoths are terrific! There’s nothing greater than a
mammoth, because a mammoth, basically you can wrap yourself in the fur from
the mammoth, you can eat the meat of the mammoth, and you can use the bones of
the mammoth, to catch other mammoths! <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>“Now this world is a fantastically good world for me.” And, part of how we
come to take command of our world, to take command of our environment, to make
these tools that are actually able to do this, is we ask ourselves questions
about it the whole time. So this man starts to ask himself questions. “This
world,” he says, “well, who … so, so who made it?” Now, of course he
thinks that, because he makes things himself, so he’s looking for someone who
will have <em>made</em> this world. He says, “So, who would have made this world?
Well, it must be something a little bit like me. Obviously much much bigger,
<span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> and necessarily invisible, <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span> but he would have made
it. Now, why did he make it?”</p>
<p>Now, we always ask ourselves “why” because we look for intention around us,
because we always do something with intention. You know, we boil an
egg in order to eat it. So, we look at the rocks and we look at the trees, and
we wonder what intention is here, even though it doesn’t have intention. So we
think, what did this person who made this world intend it for. And this is the
point where you think, “Well, it fits <em>me</em> very well. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> You know,
the caves and the forests, and the stream, and the mammoths.
He must have made it for me! I mean, there’s no other conclusion you can
come to.”</p>
<p>And it’s rather like a puddle waking up one morning—I know they don’t normally
do this, but allow me, I’m a science fiction writer. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> A puddle
wakes up one morning and thinks, “This is a very interesting world I find myself
in. It fits me very neatly.
In fact, it fits me so neatly, I mean, really precise, isn’t it?
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> It must have been made to have me in it!” And the sun rises, and
he’s continuing to narrate the story about this hole being made to have him in
it. And the sun rises, and gradually the puddle is shrinking and shrinking and
shrinking, and by the time the puddle ceases to exist, it’s still thinking,
it’s still trapped in this idea, that the hole was there for it. And if we
think that the world is here for us, we will continue to destroy it in the way
that we’ve been destroying it, because we think we can do no harm.</p>
<p>There’s an awful lot of speculation one way or another at the moment, about
whether there’s life on other planets or not. Carl Sagan, as you know, was
very keen on the idea that there must be. The sheer numbers dictate, because
there are billions and billions and billions <span class="action-description">(laughter)</span>—as he famously did
not say, in fact—of worlds out there, so the chance must be that there’s other
intelligent life out there. There are other voices at the moment you’ll hear
saying, well actually if you look at the set of circumstances here on Earth,
they are so extraordinarily specific that the chances of there being something
like this out there, are actually pretty remote.
Now, in a way it doesn’t matter. Because think of this—I mean Carl Sagan, I
think, himself, said this. There are two possibilities: either there is life
out there on other planets, or there is no life out there on other planets.
They are both utterly extraordinary ideas! <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> But, there is a strong
possibility that there isn’t anything out there remotely like this. And we are
behaving as if this planet, this extraordinary, utterly, utterly extraordinary
little ball of life, is something we can just screw about with any way we
like.</p>
<p>And maybe we can’t. Maybe we should be looking after it just a little bit
better. Not for the world’s sake—we talk rather grandly about “saving the
world.” We don’t have to save the world–the world’s fine! The world has been
through five periods of mass extinction. Sixty-five million years ago when, as
it seems, a comet hit the Earth at the same time that there were vast volcanic
eruptions in India, which saw off the dinosaurs, and something like 90% of the
life on the planet at the time. Go back another, I think is 150 million
years earlier than that, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian-Triassic_boundary">Permian-Triassic boundary</a>, another giant,
giant, giant extinction. The world has been through it many many times before.
And what tends to happen, what happens invariably after each mass extinction,
is that there’s a huge amount of space available, for new forms of life
suddenly to emerge and flourish into. Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs
made way for us. Without that extinction, we would not be here.</p>
<p>So, the world is fine. We don’t have to save the world—the world is big
enough to look after itself. What we have to be concerned about, is whether or
not the world we live in, will be capable of sustaining us in it. That’s what
we need to think about. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
<h2>Questions and answers</h2>
<p>And now if anybody has any questions, I’m very happy to take questions, and
there are microphones down here at the front so I suggest you use them.</p>
<p>Yeah, hi.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner 1:</strong> <em>Thank you. Wonderful talk. You say we should take care to not
destroy the planet. There is one suggestion that has been made is that, the
reason why we destroy the planet is that we don’t pay the true cost of things
when we consume them. The price of gasoline has been falling in real dollars
and the vehicles get bigger and bigger, we have the Selfish Useless
Vehicles—I think they’re called—the SUV’s.</em> <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
<p>You know, I have to say as a brit, you know we sit and think, “the americans
are complaining again because their gas prices have reached now nearly a
quarter of what we pay.” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Questioner 1:</strong> <em>So, I just wonder whether you think that a good solution is that
if we would pay the true cost of things, if we would pay the ten dollars a
gallon or whatever it really costs in terms of the impact on the environment,
that that might make a difference?</em></p>
<p>Umm. It may be …, I …, it … <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>There is a problem I’m very very conscious of here. Which is that, even though
I’m talking from a conservationist point of view, very very strongly, you’d
look back over the history of what we and the conservation movement have said
in the last ten years, and the previous ten years, and previous ten years of
that. And most of what we’ve said we have to do about it, or the way to have
gone about it, have actually turned out to be wrong. So, it’s very hard for me
to pretend I can stand up and say we have to do this, and we have to do that.
Because they may not be the right solution. I’m terribly aware of this as far
as, I mean just going back again, I mean thinking about sort of protection of
animals in Africa, for instance. That time after time, we’ve gone about it the
wrong way. And, yeah, the conservation efforts of once every ten years will be
as much as anything else, undoing the problems caused by the last ten years.
So it is a question of constant sort of self-education, trying to assimilate
the information, trying to see what the consequences of what we’ve done so far
has been, what we can learn from that. Now it may well be that if we say we’re
going to multiply the cost of gas by ten times or whatever, that may have
effects that we would put into … they would be the lure of unintended
consequences, which comes into play. I think the best thing we can do is
continually inform ourselves, be as aware as possible of what is actually
happening, how if that kind of feedback loop saying now we’re going to make
the true cost of the damage we’re causing be part of what you have to pay,
then that may be very well be a very good answer; but I’m also worried that it
may <em>not</em> be the answer. Which is a complicated way of saying “I don’t know.”
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Questioner 2:</strong> <em>Two questions. First. D’you know where your towel is?</em>
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>No. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Questioner 2:</strong> <em><span class="action-description">(Laughs.)</span> OK</em>.</p>
<p>That was always my problem. It’s very funny the thing about the towel because,
… I’ll tell you where it came from. I was on a holiday with a bunch of
people, and we were on a Villa in Corfu. And every day we would set out to
the beach, and just as we were setting out for the beach there would be a
problem, and the problem would be that Douglas could not find his towel!
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Where was my towel? Was it under the bed? Was it on the end of
bed? Was it <em>in</em> the bed? Was it the bathroom? Was it hanging on the line
outside? Was it in the washing…? Was it…? I had no idea, day after day,
where the f… my towel was. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> And after I while I just began to
think this must be symptomatic of somebody who is so sort of deeply chaotic.
But I then… I don’t even know whether I even came up with it first, or
somebody on the holiday came with the idea that somebody who was rather
more together than I, would be someone who would really know where their towel
was. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And so then, when I was writing the Hitchhiker, I sort of put… You very
often put things in because you know what they mean. And it’s really kind of a
flag to yourself that in the next draft through you would put something in
that means to everybody else what this thing means to you. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> You
know. And then it kind of stays there, and it turns out that it does mean
something to everybody else as well.</p>
<p>Does that answer your question?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner 2:</strong> <em>OK. And also, do we behave like people descended from
stick-using monkeys or people descended from telephone cleaners.</em></p>
<p>I think we have both lots there in our genes, I’m afraid. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Questioner 3:</strong> <em>I’m absolutely going to kill myself if I get out of here without
asking this. This question occurred to me when my friend bodily forced me to
pick up the first book in The Hitchhiker’s Guide and I read the very first
sentences on the very first paragraph, “What on God’s green Earth does this man
has against digital watches!?”</em> <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>Well I have to admit they’ve improved since <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> I actually wrote that
bit. But if you think about it, I mean the first digital watches which were…
You look at a regular watch with hands and you got a pie chart. Remember the
time when were used to get very excited about pie charts being the thing that
computer did for us? <span class="action-description">(waves in exaggeration)</span> “Uhhh! Pie charts!”
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> But at the same time when we were getting terribly excited about
pie charts and what they could do for our understanding of the world, we were
saying, “We don’t want pie charts on our wrists. That’s old fashioned
technology. No what we want is not something you just glance at and see what
the time is. We want something that you’ve got to go into a dark corner and put
down your suitcase and press a button in order to read, ‘Oh it’s 11:43,
now what is …? uhm …? How long is that before twelve o’clock?’” And this
was progress. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>But you see, I mean the great thing about human beings, I mean—while we make
fun of it—is not only that we invent stuff that’s new, and better, and does
things better. But even stuff that works perfectly well we can’t leave well
enough alone, and it’s really the most sort of charming and delightful aspect
of human beings, that we keep on inventing things that we’ve already got right
once. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> I mean like bathroom faucets, I mean it’s very very simple,
you turn it on the water comes out, you turn it off the water stops. And we
kind of got the hang of that. That works. But it’s amazing you go into, you
know, a hotel lobby or an airport, and you approach the basin with a certain
amount of sort of anxiety, you know. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> “What do I do? Do I turn
something? Do I push something? Do I <em>pull</em> something? Do I knee it!?
<span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Do I just have to sort of <em>be</em> in near it?” <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span></p>
<p>And once the water started to flow because it has picked up some sort of
brainwave energy from me or whatever. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> “So, now how do I stop it?
Is it my job to stop it? <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> Would it stop itself?” I mean, I think
we’ve got the faucet down OK. But, I just think it’s wonderful we just sort of keep
on inventing it even though it works, because it’s the way of getting
ourselves off local maximums isn’t it?</p>
<p>I think that’s all I have to say there. Thanks. <span class="action-description">(Laughter.)</span> <span class="action-description">(Applause.)</span></p>
